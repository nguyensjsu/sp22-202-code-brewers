## Week 1

**Work to do**
* Researching about game topics
* Brainstorming about different patterns that can be implemented in the game

**Blockers** 
* ---

**Xp Core Values**
* **Simplicity**: 
  * The whole team throughout the meetings presented great ideas quickly on how one design/game would be less complex and more effective than the other ones

## Week 2

**Accomplished Work**
* Finalized on car game from greenfoot scenarios

**Work to do**
* Come up with design patterns which can help optimize the project code based on the scenario selected
* Select one platform to develop the scenario

**Blockers**
* Desgin Patterns finalization took time due to doubt clarifications and minor scenario conflicts 

**Xp Core Values**
* **Simplicity**: 
  * The team members focused on the effectiveness while discussing desing patterns
  * Just fitting patterns for the sake of implementation was never the case and we selected a game in which pattern implementation would really have great meaningful impact

## Week 3

**Accomplished Work**
* Proposed and finalized effective design patterns (Singleton and Command Pattern) that can be implemented in the project
* Selected greenfoot as the platform to develop the scenario

**Work to do**
* Structure the code and start implementing the decided design pattern as per the scenario's requirements

**Blockers**
* ---

**Xp Core Values**
* **Simplicity**: 
  * Kept the meetings focused on assigning each individual a pattern from the ones decided and topics were never shifted to anything not asked for
  * Concise and to the point discussions led to faster task assignment and ideas on implementation
