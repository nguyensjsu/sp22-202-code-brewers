## Week - 1

#### Work to do:
- Explored Greenfoot, discussed potential game development that could be worked up on.
- Discussed on various project ideas. 
- Researched on the game implementations and discussed the prospective design patterns that could be used to implement the game. 

#### Blockers: None

#### XP Value: Courage

## Week - 2

#### Previous work
- Finalized the project idea and researched on Game development platform

#### Work to do:
- Proposed a design pattern that could be utilized to implement the project.
- Finalized the Greenfoot Game development platform

#### Blockers:
- Couldn't finalize on design patterns that could be used to implement the Game

#### XP Value: Courage
- We considered a variety of game creation platforms. However, after a week of investigation, we discovered that Greenfoot engine provides all of the features we'll need for the project. The team was hesitant to embrace the change in the beggening, but I encouraged them, and we were eventually able to adapt to the Greenfoot.

## Week - 3

#### Previous work
- Discussed all the project requirements and finalized GreenFoot as the game development platform.
- Presented the use of Decorator design pattern to the team and finalized to use that for project implementation. 

#### Work to do:
- Start with developing the world for GreenFoot.
- Implementing the Decorator design pattern as proposed and decided in the previous meeting.

#### Blockers:None

#### XP Value: Courage
- Discussed multiple design patterns we could use for the project module implementation. However, after a week of research on how we can logically use the design patterns, we thought that we could possibly provide various crash elements like potholes, lifeline and traffic barrigates and use decorator design pattern to implement the module. We were first hesitant to use decorator pattern to provide change in score using that, but I encouraged the team, and we finally decided to go with Decorator design pattern.


## Week - 4

#### Previous work
- Implemented the basic decorator pattern structure required for game implemention.
- Understood the world and actos implementaions in Greenfoot.

#### Work to do:
- Implement the logic and functions to the decorator design pattern.
- Integrating the modules and design patterns altogether to execute the complete game. 

#### Blockers: none

#### XP Value: Courage
- The individual implementation of the code was easy but when it comes to integrating all the team members code contributions and running it together was complex, hence I provided my team courage to integrate the individual contributions.
