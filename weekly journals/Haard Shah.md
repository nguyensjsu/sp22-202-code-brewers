## Week 1

**Work to do**: Research on Greenfoot and discuss whether a game is to be implemented or an interactive application. Also, discuss the ideas of which design patterns would be implemented along with the structure of code.

**Blockers**: None

**Xp Core Values**<br>
**Respect**: The respect in the team was maintained throughout the week while communicating different ideas and also while listening to the feedbacks that each and every member had to provide.
<br>
**Feedback**: In order to finalize the project idea, gathered feedback from every team member.

## Week 2

**Work done last week**: Suggested Strategy pattern which can be implemented in the project. Here, Strategy would be implemented as different levels of the game. There would exist different maps and also speed of the car would be different in the respective maps which can handled as different strategies while implementing in Greenfoot.

**Work to do**: Decide actors that would included in the project scope and start building the main screen of the project along with the mini-world in GreenFoot.

**Blockers**: Not finalizing the design patterns to be implemented in the first week meant that research on Greenfoot was pushed back by a week.

**Xp Core Values**<br>
**Respect**: While suggesting different design patterns in the meeting, each member had a sense of respect in order to listen to the suggestions and once they complete, giving their feedback in order to provide clarity and simplicity to the project. 
<br>
**Feedback**: Gathered feedback on the design patterns suggested by the team members and held a discussion on how the project can benefit from the implementation of different design patterns proposed.
