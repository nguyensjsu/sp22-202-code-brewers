## Week 2

**Work done last week**: Researched on different kinds of games that can be implemented and finalized on the car dodging game with specifications to be discussed in the weekly meeting.  

**Work to do**: Suggest design patterns which can be implemented in the project. Also, discuss on the platform on which the game needs to be implemented based on the known information regarding the project and perform some basic research with respect to that.

**Blockers**: Not finalizing the design patterns to be implemented in the first week meant that research on Greenfoot was pushed back by a week.

**Xp Core Values**<br>
**Respect**: While suggesting different design patterns in the meeting, each member had a sense of respect in order to listen to the suggestions and once they complete, giving their feedback in order to provide clarity and simplicity to the project. 
<br>
**Feedback**: Gathered feedback on the design patterns suggested by the team members and held a discussion on how the project can benefit from the implementation of different design patterns proposed.
