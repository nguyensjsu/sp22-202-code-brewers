## Week 1

**Work to do**: Research on Greenfoot and discuss whether a game is to be implemented or an interactive application. Also, discuss the ideas of which design patterns would be implemented along with the structure of code.

**Blockers**: None

**Xp Core Values**<br>
**Respect**: The respect in the team was maintained throughout the week while communicating different ideas and also while listening to the feedbacks that each and every member had to provide.
<br>
**Feedback**: In order to finalize the project idea, gathered feedback from every team member.

## Week 2

**Work done last week**: Researched on different kinds of games that can be implemented and finalized on the car dodging game with specifications to be discussed in the weekly meeting.  

**Work to do**: Suggest design patterns which can be implemented in the project. Also, discuss on the platform on which the game needs to be implemented based on the known information regarding the project and perform some basic research with respect to that.

**Blockers**: Not finalizing the design patterns to be implemented in the first week meant that research on Greenfoot was pushed back by a week.

**Xp Core Values**<br>
**Respect**: While suggesting different design patterns in the meeting, each member had a sense of respect in order to listen to the suggestions and once they complete, giving their feedback in order to provide clarity and simplicity to the project. 
<br>
**Feedback**: Gathered feedback on the design patterns suggested by the team members and held a discussion on how the project can benefit from the implementation of different design patterns proposed.

## Week 3

**Work done last week**: Suggested Strategy pattern which can be implemented in the project. Here, Strategy would be implemented as different levels of the game. There would exist different maps and also speed of the car would be different in the respective maps which can handled as different strategies while implementing in Greenfoot.  

**Work to do**: Start implementing Strategy pattern as per the discussions. Also, create different classes and interfaces according to the actors agreed upon in the meetings. Start drafting class diagrams along side coding the individual classes in Greenfoot  

**Blockers**: None

**Xp Core Values**<br>
**Respect**: During the meeting, each and every individual respected each other's thoughts in terms of deciding upon which platform to utilize in the project and came up to Greenfoot as a solution to the project implementation approach.
<br>
**Feedback**: Gathered feedback in terms of firstly which tool to use in order to build up the project intended. Also, feedback from each and every participant was gathered regarding the classes and interface that would be needed in the coming weeks of development.

## Week 4

**Work done last week**: Implemented Strategy pattern in terms of 2 levels. These 2 levels differ on the speed of the obstacles that drop from the top of the screen in Greenfoot. The first level is an easier one with slow speed while the second one is a little difficult based on fast speed.

**Work to do**: Integrating the code compartments of different members in order to make the game complete. Also, finalizing class diagram and other diagrams needed to completed before the deadline.

**Blockers**: None

**Xp Core Values**<br>
**Respect**: Each one of the members explained the logic of how they had implemented different design patterns in the project to which all gave respect in the sense that they listened to them with an open mind and understood what each one was describing.
<br>
**Feedback**: After each of the team members explained their logic, gathered feedback on what other thought of the implementation and discussed further on if there were ways to improve on the same.
