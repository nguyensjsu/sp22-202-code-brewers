# Weekly Journal
## Week 1
### Work to do:
- Finalizing the project idea and scope
- Explore any game inventing platform
- Proposing a design pattern which will be required to solve the problem

### Blockers


### XP Value: Communication
- Arranged a meeting to get to know each other and get different project ideas from each member. 
- With proper feedback points based communication from other teammates for each proposed project idea by a teammate, 
finalized the scope of the project.


## Week 2
### Previous Work:
- Finalized idea and scope of the project
- Explored MIT App Inventor platform to develop games

### Work to do:
- Propose a design pattern which will be required to solve the problem(Backlog item: Higher Priority)
- Discuss explored platforms (i.e. Unity, Greenfoot, MIT App Inventor)
- Finalize which platform should be used

### Blockers
- Could not decide on design patterns that will be required in order to implement the software system.

### XP Value: Communication
- Arranged a meeting to discuss the progress so far and agenda for the week. 
- All explored platforms have been discussed with their pros and cons. Each team member shared their perspective on 
which platform makes sense for the problem statement we're dealing with.
- With proper communication of ideas, we finalized Greenfoot platform to use for implementation our game.


## Week 3
### Previous Work:
- Proposed State Design Pattern to have different states like NoLifeLineState, OneLifeLineState, TwoLifeLineState,
ThreeLifeLineState.
- Finalized required design patterns based on the discussion and suggestions from team members.  
- Discussed all the game development platforms explored so far and decided to go with greenfoot

### Work to do:
- Implement assigned design pattern
- Start drafting class diagram supporting your implementation
- Start drafting high level architecture diagram

### Blockers


### XP Value: Communication
- Arranged a Scrum meeting to talk about the ideas and progress on assigned tasks.
- Finalized to go with greenfoot platform for development.
- Discussed all suggestions regarding required design patterns from team members and with collective feedback, decided 
5 necessary design patterns to be incorporated for the game development.


## Week 4
### Previous Work:
- Implemented State Design Pattern to have different states like NoLifeLineState, OneLifeLineState, TwoLifeLineState,
  ThreeLifeLineState. 
- Interfaces (ICarState and ICarStateMachine) are created to support the implementation of State Design Pattern.
- Drafted Class Diagram (for each individual design pattern developed) and Component Diagram.

### Work to do:
- Integrate of various components developed by the team members.
- Create Class Diagram and Component Diagram.
- Document work in README.
- Test the integrated version before the demo day.

### Blockers


### XP Value: Communication
- Set up meeting to discuss progress of the team and project.
- Each team member presented their implementation of design pattern and other members shared their feedback.
- Noted down the opinions of the team-mates regarding the implementation.
- Opened up a discussion on the plan for integration and documentation phase of the project.
